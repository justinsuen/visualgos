# VisuAlgos

[VisuAlgos](http://www.justinsuen.com/projects/visualgos) is a JavaScript project intended to help users visualize how different algorithms work. It is created with vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, and styled with CSS3 in HTML5.

## Features
- [x] Generate mazes
- [x] Set start and end points
- [x] Choose algorithm to be ran
- [x] An instructions tooltip

## Design
This visualizer uses a simple grid system where a starting block is placed at the `(0, 0)` position. To run a visualization, the user just has to click an open square on the grid and the algorithm will run.

![AStar with path](docs/images/astar-path.png)

The side bar contains simple intuitive instructions, options for the algorithm and grid, and a minimal legend for identifying grid components. The visualizer displays the visited squares first and once the end node is visited, a path is drawn from start to end. The path is the shortest path calculated using the algorithm chosen.

The visualizer supports different grid sizes based on user preference. The **Generate Maze** button allows the user to generate randomized mazes as desired.

![Breadth first](docs/images/breadth-first-spread.png)

As the algorithm runs almost instantly, `setTimeout` methods were used the build the visited nodes on screen. Later, the path is also drawn with a calculated timeout.

After three seconds pass, the grid is cleared with the end node acting as the new start node. Here is a sample of the helper methods.

```javascript
showActive(path, i) {
  this.getElement(path[i]).addClass("path");
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (i < path.length - 2)
      this.showActive(path, i+1);
  }, 800/this.gridSize);
}
```

## Algorithms

Currently, the visualizer supports three algorithms: Breadth-first search, Depth-first search, and A* search. All of these are implemented here as path-finding algorithms with a Manhattan heuristic and no diagonals allowed.

Manhattan distances are calculated as follows:

```javascript
static manhattan(p1, p2) {
  const dx = Math.abs(p2.x - p1.x);
  const dy = Math.abs(p2.y - p1.y);
  return dx + dy;
}
```

### A* Search

The A* algorithm was implemented with arrays acting as the open and closed sets. Graph nodes were stored in a class with respective `f, g, and h` scores. Here are snippets of the implementation:

```javascript
// Here the lowest scored node is found for the next visit
for (let i = 0; i < openSet.length; i++) {
  if (openSet[i].f < openSet[lowestInd].f)
    lowestInd = i;
}

...

// With all the neighbors of our currentNode, we calculate gScores
// accordingly and update fScores but using Manhattan distances.
for (let i = 0; i < neighbors.length; i++) {
  let n = neighbors[i];

  if (n.closed || n.weight === 0)
    continue;

  let gScore = currNode.g + 1;
  let bestGScore = false;

  if (!n.visited) {
    bestGScore = true;
    n.visited = true;
    n.h = AStar.manhattan(n.pos, this.end.pos);
    openSet.push(n);
  } else if (gScore < n.g) {
    bestGScore = true;
  }

  if (bestGScore) {
    n.parent = currNode;
    n.g = gScore;
    n.f = n.g + n.h;
  }
}
```

### Breadth-first Search

BFS here was implemented with an array as a queue. Nodes were pushed into a closed set once it was visited.

```javascript
currNode.closed = true;
closedSet.push(currNode);

let neighbors = graph.neighbors(currNode);
for (let i = 0; i < neighbors.length; i++) {
  let n = neighbors[i];

  if (n.closed || n.weight === 0)
    continue;

  if (!n.visited) {
    n.visited = true;
    n.parent = currNode;
    queue.push(n);
  }
}
```

### Depth-first Search

For this project, DFS was implemented with an array as the stack. To find the path associated with the proper nodes, we also had to have a "path cache" array stored with the node:

```javascript
// Each stack push will be an array of two things:
// 1. The node
// 2. The current path that leads to the node
let stack = [[start, []]];
```

As with BFS and A*, we visit nodes and push it into our storage:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < neighbors.length; i++) {
  let n = neighbors[i];

  if (n.weight === 0)
    continue;

  // Storage here looks different with the extra arrays
  if (n.x === end.x && n.y === end.y) {
    return { path: currPath.concat([n]), closedSet: closedSet.concat([currNode]) };
  }

  if (!n.visited) {
    n.visited = true;
    n.parent = currNode;
    stack.push([n, currPath.concat([n])]);
  }
}
```
